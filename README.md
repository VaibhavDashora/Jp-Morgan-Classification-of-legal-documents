# Jp-Morgan-Classification-of-legal-documents
🏛️ JP Morgan Legal Document Classification

📘 Project Overview
This project replicates JP Morgan’s COIN (Contract Intelligence) initiative, which automates the classification of legal documents using machine learning. By applying the CRISP-DM methodology, the goal is to build a model that reduces manual review time and improves accuracy in identifying legal clauses.

🧠 Problem Statement
Legal teams at JP Morgan spend over 360,000 hours annually reviewing contracts. Manual errors can lead to costly loan-servicing mistakes. This project aims to:

Automate classification of legal documents (e.g., loan contracts, bank reports).

Identify and categorize clauses using NLP and image recognition.

Enable scalable review of complex filings like credit-default swaps and custody agreements.

🎯 Business Goals
⏱️ Reduce time spent on contract reviews

✅ Minimize human error in legal analysis

📈 Support more complex financial filings

🤖 Build a reliable ML model for clause classification
